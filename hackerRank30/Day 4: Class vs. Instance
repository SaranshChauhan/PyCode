Objective
In this challenge, we're going to learn about the difference between 
a class and an instance; because this is an Object Oriented concept, 
it's only enabled in certain languages. Check out the Tutorial tab 
for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer,initialAge , as a parameter.
The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; 
if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. 

In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If age < 13, print You are young..
If age >= 13 and ,age <  18 print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..
To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, 
much of the code is provided for you, but you'll be writing everything in the future.
The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method.
Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!

#Solution
class Person:
    def __init__(self, initialAge):
        # Add some more code to run some checks on initialAge
        self.age = 0 
        #first initialize age to 0
        #check if initialAge is less than 0, print invalid else assign to age
        if initialAge < 0:
            print("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.")
        else:
            self.age = initialAge


    def amIOld(self):
        # Do some computations in here and print out the correct statement to the console
        if (age < 13):
            print("You are young.")
        elif (age >= 13 and age < 18):
            print("You are a teenager.")
        elif (age >= 18):
            print("You are old.")

    def yearPasses(self):    
        # Increment the age of the person in here
        global age #can modify age outside of the current scope. 
        age += 1
